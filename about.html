            <p>
              I am Sri Lankan by nationality but I have lived all my life in Zambia. 
        My first time coming to Boston was when I moved into Northeastern University. 
        Two years later and I'm still happy as can be studying Computer Science and exploring new ways to solve problems.
				My primary interests are in mobile and software development, however I would like to learn more about machine learning and natural language processing.
